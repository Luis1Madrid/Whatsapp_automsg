# Whatsapp_automsg
Using Selenium, automate a list of numbers/contact to send messages through whatsapp.

The following are the steps to successfully use this code:

1-  install selenium
2-  get the correct WebDrive for Chrome
3-  Using chrome, log once into whatsapp web. (this is require since the first time it will ask to link using QR code)
4-  Variable list_people can contain names (exact naming saved on phone) or first time use numbers (include country code, do not add a + sign)
5-  Variable messageT is the automatic message to send to users

If code breaks; double check class and titles reference within the code. Webpage may have updated some of them.
